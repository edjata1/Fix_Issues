Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-router-dom'

vulnerable dependencies

This worked for me not sure it will work for you, but here goes:

New to react, I wasn't sure why or what these vulnerable dependencies issues were, 
but it sounding like trouble. 3 days I was looking for answers and all the experts
and coder had the same fix:

npm audit fix --force
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-audit

It didn't work for me, in fact I got more vulnerabilities errors hundreds.
What was 6 turned to 65 to 105. It was crazy!

With these three sites I put the following together:
Thinking these are just files and folders. If the folder and files are missing just add it

1. delete your node_modules and package-lock.json (not package.json) files.
These didn't work for me:

# 👇️ delete node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json

2. clear cache:
# 👇️ clean npm cache
npm cache clean --force

I WENT INTO THE PROJECT FOLDER AND DELETED THEM THERE!

3. open your package.json file
{
  // ... rest
  "dependencies": {
    "react-router-dom": "^6.3.0",
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // 👇️ only if you use TypeScript
    "@types/react-router-dom": "^5.3.3"
  }
}

4. install in project directory c:\myproject shell/console window: 
npm install

5. in shell/console: npm install react-router-dom@6

npm install react-router-dom@latest#
